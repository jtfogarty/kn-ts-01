1. Backend API Development:
   - Create Knative service for the backend API
   - Implement serverless functions for handling search requests
   - Set up error handling and logging

2. Ollama Integration:
  - Configure the backend to communicate with the existing Ollama service
  - Implement API endpoints in the backend to interface with Ollama
  - Ensure proper error handling and timeouts for Ollama requests
  - Optimize performance and manage concurrent requests to Ollama

3. Typesense Setup:
   - ~~Deploy Typesense as a stateful set in Kubernetes~~
   - Create and configure search indexes
   - Implement API for Typesense operations (indexing, searching)

4. Backend-Frontend Integration:
   - Update frontend to make requests to the backend API
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states in the frontend

5. Istio Configuration:
   - Set up Istio gateway and virtual services for routing
   - Configure traffic management between services
   - Implement security policies (mTLS, authorization)

6. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Set up logging aggregation (e.g., Fluentd, Elasticsearch, Kibana)
   - Implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger)
   - Configure metrics collection and dashboards (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)

7. Testing:
   - Develop unit tests for backend functions
   - Create integration tests for the entire system
   - Perform load testing to ensure scalability

8. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement canary deployments or blue-green deployments

9. Documentation:
   - Create API documentation
   - Write deployment and operation guides
   - Document system architecture and design decisions

10. Performance Optimization:
    - Analyze and optimize LLM inference performance
    - Fine-tune Typesense for faster search results
    - Optimize Knative autoscaling settings
