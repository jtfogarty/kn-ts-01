# This YAML defines a Knative Service, which combines both the service and deployment aspects.
# Knative abstracts away the need for separate Kubernetes Service and Deployment resources.
# The container/image specification is included because Knative manages the entire lifecycle
# of the application, including creating and scaling the underlying pods.
# This approach simplifies deployment and enables serverless-style scaling.
